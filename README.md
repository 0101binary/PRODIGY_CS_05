- **Protocol identification** with service name mappings
- **MAC and IP address formatting**
- **TCP flag analysis** (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)
- **Capture statistics** and summary reports
- **Ethical use reminders** throughout the tool

## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.6+** (uses only standard library)
- **Administrator/Root privileges** (required for raw socket access)
- **Network interface** with active connection

### Optional Dependencies
For enhanced features, you can install:
```bash
pip install scapy>=2.4.5    # Advanced packet manipulation
pip install psutil>=5.8.0    # System utilities
pip install colorama>=0.4.4  # Colored output
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone or download** the tool files
2. **Navigate** to the project directory
3. **Run with appropriate privileges**:

### Windows (Run as Administrator)
```powershell
python packet_sniffer.py
```

### Linux/macOS (Run with sudo)
```bash
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Capture 100 packets (default)
python packet_sniffer.py

# Capture 50 packets
python packet_sniffer.py -n 50

# Use specific interface
python packet_sniffer.py -i eth0

# Show help
python packet_sniffer.py --help
```

### Command Line Options
- `-n, --num-packets`: Maximum packets to capture (default: 100)
- `-i, --interface`: Network interface to use (default: auto-detect)
- `--version`: Show version information
- `--help`: Show help message

## üîç What You'll Learn

### Network Concepts
- **Packet structure** and header analysis
- **Protocol identification** and behavior
- **Port and service mapping**
- **TCP connection states** and flags
- **Network traffic patterns**

### Security Insights
- **Traffic analysis** techniques
- **Protocol vulnerabilities** understanding
- **Network monitoring** best practices
- **Privacy considerations** in networking

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

### Built-in Protections
- **Educational focus** with clear ethical guidelines
- **Limited payload display** to prevent sensitive data exposure
- **No data logging** or persistent storage
- **Real-time analysis** only

### Best Practices
